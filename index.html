<h1>    1. Difference between var and let:</h1>


    <ul>var is function-scoped, meaning it is accessible within the function it is declared in, regardless of block boundaries (such as loops or conditionals).</ul>
    <ul>let is block-scoped, meaning it is only accessible within the block it is declared in (like loops or conditionals). It has a more limited scope than var and helps avoid certain types of bugs caused by variable hoisting and unintended reassignment.</ul>

<br>  
<h1>    2.	Difference between var and const:</h1>

    <ul>var allows reassignment and its value can be changed.</ul>
    <ul> also has block scope like let, but it is a constant and cannot be reassigned once a value is assigned to it.</ul>

 <br>   
<h1>    3.	Difference between let and const:</h1>

    <ul>let allows reassignment of its value within its scope. </ul>
    <ul>const is a constant and its value cannot be changed once assigned.</ul>

<br>    
<h1>4.	Hoisting: </h1>
    
    <p>Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. However, only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations or assignments.</p>
